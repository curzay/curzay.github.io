San Francisco levels of crime are a public concern for inhabitants and policy makers. In terms of crimes per square mile, the national median is around 26.8, while in San Francisco is of 938. Within California, the city of San Francisco stands out as one of the most dangerous cities, as the rate in this state is of 83. Economic and human resources are being allocated into reduce these numbers, but many question if the optimization of these resources is being done in the most reasonable way. As Data Science techniques evolve, they are becoming a powerful tool to identify crime patterns that had been previously ignored. 

Sexual offenses are an especially important crime type to address, as society is becoming more and more aware of how women security can boost a city in different fields (economics, quality of life, culture, tourismâ€¦). To make a real analysis of this type of crime in the city of San Francisco, it is important that a reliable dataset is available for it. This magazine has identified an error on how these crimes are reported.

It is difficult to think that almost all sexual offenses are happening at 00:00, as shown in the figure above. Probably, police in San Francisco are not recording correctly at which hour they are happening. What would London Breed, major of the city, think about this? Is this creating a bias on how police resources are distributed? Is this official data being used to make any decisions? 

However, and, although we have pointed out that this data is not as precise as any data scientist would require for a proper analysis, we have been able to merge this dataset with the locations of some of the most popular clubs among San Franciscans. In the following graph, you will be able to identify if your party tonight is safe enough or if, otherwise, you should consider not walking alone today.
